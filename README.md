# My-Portfolio

At this point in my github commits it pretty important to mention that I had this whole portfolio practically built allready but unfortunetaly do to some currupted data I lost the whole project, thankfully there at least were pieces of it within discord post and reddit pages from when I had questions about issues I was running into which allowed to to salvage some of my css and html code.
