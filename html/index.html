                    <h3>About me</h3>
                    <p>I am a dedicated Computer Science student at Eastern Washington University, set to complete my Bachelor of Science in Fall 2024, with a minor in Cyber Security. My academic journey has provided me with a strong foundation in both fields, with a particular focus on network security, cryptographic algorithms, and ethical hacking techniques. A highlight of my studies is the Data Structure Visualization project, an interactive website that I developed alongside my peers. This project, available on my GitHub profile, showcases my skills in both front-end and back-end development, utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Firebase to create a functional and educational tool.
                    <p>Beyond academics, my experience as a Shift Supervisor at Papa Murphy’s has honed my leadership, communication, and problem-solving abilities. Overseeing daily operations and managing a team has taught me the value of teamwork and adaptability in dynamic environments. On a personal note, I recently got married and am thrilled to be expecting my first child. Balancing my passion for technology with a love for the outdoors, I am eager to begin an internship and apply my skills in real-world scenarios as I embark on my career in the tech industry.</p>

                                I worked with a team to develop an online data structure visualizer aimed at helping students understand key concepts like Stacks, Doubly Linked Lists, Binary Search Trees, and Max-Heaps. My contribution focused on building the Stack page, where I created an interactive control panel allowing users to push, pop, peek, and clear elements in a stack, with real-time visual updates and an adjustable animation speed. I also implemented educational sections that showcased stack implementations in Python, C, and Java, along with a detailed breakdown of time complexities and common use cases. This project was shaped by feedback from our professors at Eastern Washington University, who guided us toward addressing the areas students struggle with the most.

                            <p>I worked with a team to develop a digital version of Orbellion, a student-made card game created by Nathan Marsee, using Unity. My main contributions were designing the gameboard and implementing key early features like the health and card systems, which enabled the game to track player health, manage card draws, and move cards between zones to perform various operations. Although the project wasn’t fully completed due to time constraints, we successfully established the foundation, allowing two players to draw cards and use energy to damage each other’s Hellions. This project provided me with valuable experience in game development and system design, even in its unfinished state.</p>
