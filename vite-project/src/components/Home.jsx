            <p>I am a dedicated Computer Science student at Eastern Washington University, set to complete my Bachelor in Computer Science in the Fall of 2024, with a minor in Cyber Security. My academic journey has provided me with a strong foundation in both fields, with a particular focus on network security, cryptographic algorithms, and ethical hacking techniques. A highlight of my studies is the Data Structure Visualization project, an interactive website that I developed alongside my peers. This project, available on my GitHub profile, showcases my skills in both front-end and back-end development, utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Firebase to create a functional and educational tool.</p>
            <p>Beyond academics, my experience as a Shift Supervisor at Papa Murphyâ€™s has honed my leadership, communication, and problem-solving abilities. Overseeing daily operations and managing a team has taught me the value of teamwork and adaptability in dynamic environments. On a personal note, I recently got married and am thrilled to be expecting my first child. Balancing my passion for technology with a love for the outdoors, I am eager to begin an internship and apply my skills in real-world scenarios as I embark on my career in the tech industry.</p>
